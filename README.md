# Capstone1-eCommerce

This is the very first capstone I got to work on individually. This capstone I named Otaku Oasis. It's an manga eCommerce store where customers
can buy mangas as well as light novels and webtoons. I have made some changes compared to when I have first started working on this project awhile
ago. There will be updates on this periodically, so please check back

Here is the wireframes for my eCommerce Website
